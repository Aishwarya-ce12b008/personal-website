* The PM lifecycle bloat + organisational bloat makes us ship slow. Smallest of features take \~6 months to ship. 
* AI brought velocity to this game if we build and adopt them right
* They are building different agents in the org - Trust agent, analyst agent, growth agent, etc
* Any feature that you build - the trust agent sort of becomes a police and approves or QCs the plan and brings out the areas to focus. Growth agent - vets any ideas and gives the probability of it working etc



What goes into building these agents is more of what we feed

* The policies
* Previous experiences and outcomes
* Historical data and all the experiments conducted + results
* The agents also feeds on its own responses and gets better at it
* Invested on IDEs and tools to get this done



I think, the ability to build, control, and customise is getting more and more powerful. Initially, these were good enough but not great to move to production ready applications. Now they are. \
\
We are going to see a shift in the way of work at every organisation. While all of us know that this is is the eventuality, at LinkedIn, it is already happening. 



To build something robust that actually works for us, the organisation needs to have enough structured data to be able to feed and iterate to get the model working right.
