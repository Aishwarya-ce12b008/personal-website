1. It takes time. Whether you like it r not. There's no shortcut. You can't have quality & velocity both. You can insanely improve velocity by narrowing design system, working with Figma Code Connect, Figma MCP etc, but there's no workaround in terms spending the time for craftsmanship.
2. Don't make the user think.
3. For the 20% of product that users use 80%, think deeply about defaults, nudges, and be okay with hardcoding. It goes a long way in terms of how people feel.
4. Why invest when you can get revenue? People who love your product will tell their friends. That will get new customers. People who love your products will take it with them to their next company. It's not about hitting this quarters revenue target alone. Building great products attracts great talent. It's a self set bar that improve quality of thinking, quality of work, quality of care for users across the board. 

5. Building delightful products is as much about design as it is about product.
