I've been on the quest to build world-class products. The first step of it? Define world class products for myself and understand what I mean. Here's a repository of some of the best products I've used and I try to breakdown what makes them best for me:

1. Slack: I think they've genuinely brought in a lot of new UI UX paradigms. Threads is one. Huddle is another. They've also built a lot a lot of effort into copies. Ex: When you are in a huddle and the other person doesn't join, the copy of being in a meditative session is so endearing. Also the music that comes when you wait for the other person. The ability for a product manager to have come up with 'Smooth Jazz' as an option in a professional setting is godmode. Compare it with the usual alternatives like telephony ring and you'll know how much the product has been crafted for experience, not just for function. The @channel nudge
