My takeaways:

1. Demis is one of the few people who created a life mission early on and made every single decision in the last 20 years around it. It brought in a lot of focus and dramatically increased his chance of success. He even sold the company at a lower valuation at an un-opportune time because his mission was clear.

2. Deepmind office is really really cool. We don't have offices like that in India.

3. There's a beautiful realisation Demis has around how so many intelligent people end up spending a great deal of their life playing chess vs if they put their minds together, they can solve cancer. I also increases feel this is true about high qualified folks working on engagement increasing apps.

4. Deepmind might feel like a breakout success but they had great access, network very very early on - even without being based in SF. Peter Thiel was a seed investor and Elon Musk was Series A. In fact Elon Musk bid against Google in their acquisition and since Demis chose Google, Elon started OpenAI to counter it.

5. Good friendships go a long way. Demis's friends from college Shane, David are still the core team of DeepMind.

6. Reinforcement Learning is a beautiful thing. It might be inefficient but an amazing thing. 

7. The problem statements that Demis ends up picking have very familiar patterns. They are incredibly hard that people think they aren't solvable, the best in class solution at the time of picking the problem would have a single digit win %, 

8. You can get really far solving problems without any domain experience using RL. Ex: AlphaGo had very little Go players overseeing it. The first few versions of AlphaFold (that were still world leading) had no domain expert on the team and later on was supported by 2 member domain expert team. The implications for this are huge. You can solve domains if you can build a good model of the constraints, rules and what winning looks like.

9.
