A collection of Naval Ravikant's wisdom on building wealth, finding happiness, and living a meaningful life.

This book distills years of Naval's tweets, podcasts, and interviews into actionable wisdom. His frameworks on leverage, specific knowledge, and the difference between wealth and status are game-changing. A book I return to often.
