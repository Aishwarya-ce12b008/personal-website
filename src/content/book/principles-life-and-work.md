Ray Dalio shares the unconventional principles he used to create unique results in life and business.

Dalio's approach to radical transparency and systematic decision-making is extreme, but there's so much to learn from his rigor. The idea of treating your life and work as a machine that you can tune and improve is powerful. Even if you don't adopt all his methods, the framework for thinking about problems is invaluable.
