A lone astronaut must save Earth from an extinction-level threat, armed only with his wits, science, and an unexpected ally.

Andy Weir does it again. The science is fascinating, the humor is perfect, and the friendship at the heart of this story is unexpectedly moving. If you loved The Martian, this is even better.
