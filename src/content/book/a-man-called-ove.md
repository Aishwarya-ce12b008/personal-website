A grumpy yet loveable man finds his world turned upside down when a boisterous young family moves in next door.

What starts as a story about a curmudgeon becomes a deeply moving exploration of love, loss, and community. Backman writes with such warmth and humor that you'll laugh and cry, sometimes on the same page.
