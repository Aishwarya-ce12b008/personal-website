The memoir of Nike co-founder Phil Knight, detailing the messy, precarious journey of building Nike.

Most business biographies are sanitized victory laps. This is the opposite. Knight is honest about his doubts, his mistakes, and the sheer chaos of building Nike. It's a raw look at the grit required to build something enduring. The ending, where he reflects on what it was all for, is genuinely moving.
