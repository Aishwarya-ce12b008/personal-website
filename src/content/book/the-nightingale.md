A World War II novel about two sisters in France who must navigate the Nazi occupation and find their own ways to resist and survive.

A beautifully written, emotionally devastating story about courage, sacrifice, and the often overlooked role of women in wartime. Hannah captures both the intimate and epic scale of war. I couldn't put it down.
