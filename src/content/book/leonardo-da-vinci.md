A biography connecting Leonardo's art to his science, based on his notebooks and life.

This book dispels the myth of the divine genius and shows Leonardo as he really was—relentlessly curious, observant, and often distracted. His greatness came from his refusal to separate art from science. It's inspiring because it suggests that his 'genius' was actually a set of habits—observation and curiosity—that we can all cultivate.
