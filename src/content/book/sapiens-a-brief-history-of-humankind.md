Explores how Homo sapiens came to dominate the world, covering the cognitive, agricultural, and scientific revolutions.

This book completely reframed how I view human society. The concept of 'imagined realities'—that money, nations, and laws only exist because we collectively believe in them—is a powerful lens for understanding the world. It makes you question which of your own deeply held beliefs are just stories we've agreed to tell.
