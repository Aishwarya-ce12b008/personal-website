A guide to the art of the entrepreneur and the skill of creating and maintaining new businesses.

The definitive text on how to run a company. Grove approaches management with an engineer's mindset—looking at leverage, output, and process. The concepts of 'task relevant maturity' and the purpose of meetings are things I use every week. Dense, but incredibly high ROI per page.
