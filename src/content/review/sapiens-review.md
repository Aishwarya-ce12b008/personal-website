Sapiens is one of those books that you read and then immediately want to talk to everyone about.

## The Cognitive Revolution

The most fascinating part for me was the concept of the Cognitive Revolution. The idea that our ability to believe in shared myths—like money, gods, and nations—is what allowed us to cooperate in large numbers is mind-blowing.

## Key Takeaways

1.  **Imagined Realities**: Everything from the economy to human rights exists only because we collectively agree they do.
2.  **Happiness**: We are far more powerful than our ancestors, but are we happier? Harari argues potentially not.
3.  **Biology vs. History**: Biology sets the parameters for what is possible, but history determines what actually happens.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand *why* the world is the way it is.
